👋 Hi, I’m @RamyaSreeVanamamulai
🎓 A dedicated Master's student in Computer Science at Cleveland State University, set to graduate in May 2026.
🧠 Driven by curiosity and a commitment to lifelong learning, I'm always exploring how to use technology to create meaningful impact.
🔍 I thrive on tackling challenging problems and building smart, efficient solutions through code and creativity.
🛠️ My technical interests span across software development, algorithm design, AI, machine learning, embedded systems, and mathematical modeling.
🎲 When I’m not coding, you'll find me immersed in strategy board games or playing badminton and skipping—both of which keep me sharp and energized.

💬 Let’s connect! Whether it’s to collaborate on a project, exchange ideas, or just chat about emerging tech, I’m always open to conversations that spark innovation.
